# Updated Portfolio (V3)
My portfolio done with React. Yes - that's fancy.

## Description 

This single page React website was designed using "mobile first" design and was done in modular components. It features a modern, polished look and feel and is responsive for any screensize. It contains 5 pices of work at this point including one group project, two bootcamp projects and my personal website. There are social media links at the bottom and a link to my PDF resume.

## Credits

Kevin Powell's YouTube video's were instrumental in the style of this website. I handcoded all aspects but his videos taught me many features taht would have taken me a great deal of time to figure out on my own.
